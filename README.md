# Pac-Man-Blinky-Edition - Nitya Patel
Pac-Man: Blinky Edition  Pac-Man: Blinky Edition is a mini version of the classic Pac-Man game, created in C# using Windows Forms. In this version, you only face Blinky, the red ghost. Navigate the maze, avoid Blinky, and try to collect points while surviving! I built this game in Grade 11 as one of my high school projects.
